# Introduction

This document compares the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) diseases burden for three countries: COUNTRY 1, COUNTRY 2, and COUNTRY 3. We compare the burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNN), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and overall disease burden for these countries. 

The source data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.
