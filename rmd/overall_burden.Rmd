# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.

DALYs_Table3<-data_overall%>%
  select(countries= Entity,year=Year, DALYs=`DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)%>%
  filter(countries %in% c("Congo", "Angola", "Cote d'Ivoire"))%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = countries, values_from = DALYs)%>%kable()

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

  select(countries= Entity,year=Year, DALYs=`DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)%>%

## Summary of Overall Disease Burden Findings

Provide a brief analysis based on the data presented in the table and chart. Highlight any significant findings or patterns. About 3 sentences.


- We observe an overall decrease in DALYs annually for all three countries, with significant fluctuations between 1990 and 2020 for Angola and Congo.


- The DALYs trend in Congo is notably different from that of Angola and CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
